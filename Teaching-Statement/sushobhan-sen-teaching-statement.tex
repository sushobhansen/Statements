In a traditional university system, teaching and research are often seen as two separate activities that a faculty member is expected undertake. Indeed, the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education classifies universities based on their relative focus on teaching and research \cite{carnegie1994classification}. However, from my perspective, both of these are part of the academic activity of creating and disseminating knowledge. Therefore, I believe that a good researcher can be a good teacher, and the tools of inquiry that are applied to research can equally be applied to teaching. 

In the following paragraphs, I hope to highlight my approach to teaching through the lens of a researcher by outlining my teaching philosophy and demonstrating how I have applied it so far in the classroom. I will then conclude by outlining my plans for running my classroom as an independent scholar and teacher. 

\section*{Teaching Philosophy}
\subsection*{Pedagogical}
The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines pedagogy as, "the art, science, or profession of teaching" \cite{merriam-webster-pedagogy}. Therefore, in explaining the pedagogical aspects of my teaching philosophy, I must explain its scientific basis. My pedagogy is based on two pillars: evidence-based learning and Project-Based Learning (PBL). 

My support for evidence-based learning stems from the American Society for Engineering Education's (ASEE) call for encouraging engineering educators to make use of the scientific literature and implement innovative teaching strategies that encourage learning \cite{jamieson2009creating}. In my classroom therefore, I will implement the latest pedagogical research while also collecting data to gauge its effectiveness. Through this, I hope to continuously improve as an educator and improve my students' learning outcomes.

PBL has several definitions, but at its heart is that students should lead their own learning while the teacher acts as an enabler \cite{albanese1993problem}. I will implement PBL in my classroom to encourage meta-cognition in my students and equip them with skills to solve new problems in the future. At the same time, I will also design my classes to take into account different scholastic capabilities of students, blending PBL with other pedagogical techniques in the process.    

\subsection*{Technical}  
From a technical perspective, my teaching philosophy will be an extension of my research philosophy. I believe that a modern education should be inter-disciplinary and therefore, I look forward to teaching classes from different disciplines. Furthermore, I will focus on explaining the context of a class and how it is related to other classes that students might take. My aim will be to give students an understanding of where their knowledge stands in a larger engineering context, and how skills from other disciplines can complement their own. 

In addition, I believe that computational literacy is critical in the $21^{st}$ century. Indeed, research has shown that computational skills are demanded by students as well as employers \cite{magana2012motivation}. Therefore, my classes will focus on teaching students to use software as well as write good code to implement what they have learned.
